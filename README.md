# Local-finite-amplitude-wave-activity
This field contains python codes to compute local finite-amplitude wave activities. 

Codes for computing local wave activity (LWA) described in [Chen et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL066959). The codes were developed by Prof. Gang Chen and the original version could be traced [here](https://www.gchenpu.com/files/LWA/). The current version added the computation of meridional displacement.
